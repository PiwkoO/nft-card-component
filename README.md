## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Pseudo-classes

### What I learned

In this project I learned that even though I start with mobile-first approach then Galaxy Fold beats up other smartphones width size with his 280px. I want to work on as good accessibility as possible so it wouldn't be smart to overlook it. 

### Continued development

I want to improve user accessibility as much as possible. Unfortunately I don't own as many devices to check everything, so I must rely on built-in tools, but I do my best to make it look at least good.
